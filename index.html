                        175g (6oz) unsmoked streaky bacon rashers, rinds removed, cut into strips
                        1 onion, peeled and chopped
                        125g (4½ oz) Gruyère cheese, grated
                        2 large eggs
                        250ml (9fl oz) single cream
                        Salt and freshly ground black pepper
                        FOR THE PASTRY:
                        175g (6oz) plain flour, plus extra for dusting
                        85g (3oz) hard block margarine or chilled butter, cut into cubes
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Step 1
First make the pastry: tip the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the margarine or butter and rub in gently with fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add 3 tablespoons cold water until the pastry comes together in a ball. <br><br>

Step 2
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and use it to line a 20cm (8in) loose-bottomed flan tin. Ideally, use a fluted tin.<br><br>

Step 3
Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220˚C. Prick the pastry case all over with a fork, to prevent air bubbles forming during baking. Line the base and sides with baking parchment and weigh it down with baking beans. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the beans and paper and bake the empty case for a further 10 minutes, or until the base is lightly browned. Trim the overhanging pastry.<br><br>

Step 4
Reduce the oven temperature to 180˚C. Crisp the bacon in a sauté pan over a medium heat for 10 minutes. Transfer to the cooled pastry case with a slotted spoon. Leave the juices in the pan.<br><br>

Step 5
Place the onion in the pan and cook over a medium heat for 8 minutes or until golden. Add to the quiche Lorraine and top with the cheese.<br><br>

Step 6
In a bowl, combine the eggs, cream, salt and pepper, then pour into the quiche. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden and just set. Be careful not to overcook the quiche, or the filling will become tough and full of holes.<br><br>
